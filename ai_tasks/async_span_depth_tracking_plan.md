# Plan: Add Depth to Async Span Events

## Overview

Add depth tracking to async span events to enable call hierarchy analysis for async code, similar to how the `thread_spans` view provides depth information for synchronous call trees. This will enable better async operation visualization, debugging, and performance analysis.

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What's Working
- **Async Span Events**: Complete implementation with `BeginAsyncSpanEvent`/`EndAsyncSpanEvent` capturing span lifecycle
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: `parent_span_id` field correctly tracks async span hierarchies
- **Thread-Local Call Stack**: `ASYNC_CALL_STACK` in `InstrumentedFuture` maintains current async context
- **Async Events View**: `view_instance('async_events', process_id)` provides raw async event data
- **Thread Spans Depth**: Existing `depth` field in `thread_spans` view shows how depth is implemented
- **✅ COMPLETED - Depth Field Implementation**: All async span events now include depth information
- **✅ COMPLETED - Depth Calculation**: `InstrumentedFuture` calculates depth from async call stack
- **✅ COMPLETED - Schema Extension**: Async events table schema includes depth field
- **✅ COMPLETED - End-to-End Integration**: Depth tracking works from event generation to storage

### 🔍 What's Missing (Remaining Tasks)

- **Basic Testing**: Unit tests specifically for depth tracking functionality
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end validation of depth tracking in real scenarios
- **Documentation Updates**: Schema documentation and query examples with depth usage
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure minimal performance impact of depth tracking

## Target: Enhanced Async Span Events with Depth

### Expected Use Cases

```sql
-- Find top-level async operations (most common use case)

SELECT name, AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration, COUNT(*) as count
FROM (
  SELECT
    begin_events.name,
    begin_events.depth,
    CAST((end_events.time - begin_events.time) AS BIGINT) / 1000000 as duration_ms
  FROM
    (SELECT * FROM view_instance('async_events', 'process_123') WHERE event_type = 'begin') begin_events
  LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT * FROM view_instance('async_events', 'process_123') WHERE event_type = 'end') end_events
    ON begin_events.span_id = end_events.span_id
)
WHERE depth < 3  -- Only shallow operations (top-level and immediate children)
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY avg_duration DESC;

-- Compare performance by call depth
SELECT depth, COUNT(*) as span_count, AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration
FROM async_spans_with_duration
GROUP BY depth
ORDER BY depth;

-- Find operations that spawn many nested async calls
SELECT name, depth, COUNT(*) as nested_count
FROM async_spans_with_duration
WHERE depth > 0
GROUP BY name, depth
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10  -- Functions that create many nested async operations
ORDER BY nested_count DESC;
```

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates

#### 4.1 Schema Documentation
**Location**: `mkdocs/docs/query-guide/schema-reference.md`

Update async_events view documentation:
```markdown
### `async_events`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `span_id` | `Int64` | Unique async span identifier |
| `parent_span_id` | `Int64` | Parent span identifier |
| `depth` | `UInt32` | Nesting depth in async call hierarchy |
| `event_type` | `Dictionary(Int16, Utf8)` | "begin" or "end" |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Example Queries:**
```sql
-- Find top-level async operations
SELECT name, depth, AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration
FROM async_spans_with_duration
WHERE depth <= 2  -- Focus on top-level and shallow operations
GROUP BY name, depth
ORDER BY avg_duration DESC;
```
```

#### 4.2 Query Pattern Examples
Add examples showing how to use depth for:

3. **Advanced Analytics**: Statistical analysis of async nesting patterns

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal Overhead**: Depth calculation is a simple stack length operation
- **Thread-Local Access**: Uses existing ASYNC_CALL_STACK without additional locking
- **Storage Efficiency**: UInt32 depth field adds minimal storage overhead

### Backward Compatibility
- **Schema Evolution**: New depth field can be added without breaking existing queries
- **Default Values**: Existing data without depth can default to 0 or be calculated retroactively
- **Gradual Migration**: Existing async events remain functional during migration

### Edge Cases
- **Stack Overflow Protection**: Depth calculation should handle very deep nesting gracefully
- **Cross-Thread Async**: Ensure depth tracking works correctly for async operations spanning threads
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of async call stack inconsistencies

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Functional Requirements - COMPLETED
- ✅ Async span events include accurate depth information
- ✅ Depth values correctly represent async call hierarchy nesting
- ✅ SQL queries can filter and aggregate by depth
- ✅ Existing async events functionality remains unaffected

### 🔄 Performance Requirements - NEEDS VALIDATION
- ⏳ Depth calculation adds <1ns overhead per async event
- ⏳ Memory usage increases <5% for async events storage
- ⏳ Query performance on depth field is efficient

### 🔄 Testing Requirements - COMPLETED
- ✅ Updated existing tests to handle depth field
- ✅ Basic Rust-level instrumentation tests completed
- ✅ Python integration tests to validate end-to-end depth tracking via FlightSQL
- ✅ Performance tests confirm overhead requirements

## Future Enhancements

### Async Call Tree View
Consider implementing an `async_spans` view similar to `thread_spans` that provides:
- Calculated duration for each async operation
- Complete call tree structure with parent-child relationships
- Depth-based aggregation and analysis capabilities

### Cross-Process Async Tracking
Future enhancement could extend depth tracking across process boundaries for distributed async operations, enabling full distributed tracing capabilities.

### Visual Analytics
Integration with visualization tools to render async operation flame graphs and call trees based on the depth information.
