# Advanced Features

Advanced Micromegas features including view materialization, custom views, and system administration.

## View Materialization

Micromegas uses a lakehouse architecture with on-demand view materialization for optimal performance.

### JIT View Processing
- Raw data stored in object storage (S3/GCS)
- Views materialized on-demand when queried
- Automatic caching for frequently accessed data

### Global Views vs View Instances
- **Global views**: `log_entries`, `measures` - span all processes
- **View instances**: `view_instance('log_entries', 'process_id')` - process-scoped for performance

## Architecture Benefits

### Datalake → Lakehouse → Query
- **Datalake (S3)**: Custom binary format, cheap storage, fast writes
- **Lakehouse (Parquet)**: Columnar format, fast analytics, industry standard
- **Query Engine (DataFusion)**: SQL engine optimized for analytical workloads

### Tail Sampling Support
- Heavy data streams remain unprocessed until queried
- Cheap to store in S3, cheap to delete unused data
- Use low-frequency streams (logs, metrics) to decide sampling of high-frequency streams (spans)
