## Data Types

### Properties

Key-value pairs stored as `List<Struct>` with the following structure:

```sql
-- Properties structure
List<Struct<
    key: Utf8,
    value: Utf8
>>
```

**Common properties fields:**

- `properties` - Event-specific metadata (log properties, metric properties)
- `process_properties` - Process-wide metadata shared across all events from a process

**Querying properties:**
```sql
-- Access property values using property_get function
SELECT property_get(process_properties, 'thread-name') as thread_name
FROM log_entries
WHERE property_get(process_properties, 'thread-name') IS NOT NULL;
```

### Dictionary Compression

Most string fields use dictionary compression (`Dictionary(Int16, Utf8)`) for storage efficiency:

- Reduces storage space for repeated values
- Improves query performance
- Transparent to SQL queries - use as normal strings

### Timestamps

All time fields use `Timestamp(Nanosecond)` precision:

- Nanosecond resolution for high-precision timing
- UTC timezone assumed
- Compatible with standard SQL time functions

## View Relationships

Views can be joined to combine information:

```sql
-- Join log entries with process information
SELECT l.time, l.level, l.msg, p.exe, p.computer
FROM log_entries l
JOIN processes p ON l.process_id = p.process_id
WHERE l.level <= 2;  -- Fatal and Error only

-- Join measures with stream information
SELECT m.time, m.name, m.value, s.tags
FROM measures m
JOIN streams s ON m.stream_id = s.stream_id
WHERE m.name = 'cpu_usage';
```

## Performance Considerations

### Dictionary Fields

Dictionary-compressed fields are optimized for:

- Equality comparisons (`field = 'value'`)
- IN clauses (`field IN ('val1', 'val2')`)
- LIKE patterns on repeated values

### Time-based Queries

Always use time ranges for optimal performance:
```sql
-- Good - uses time index
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'

-- Avoid - full table scan
WHERE level <= 3
```

### View Instances

Use `view_instance()` for process-specific queries:
```sql
-- Better performance for single process
SELECT * FROM view_instance('log_entries', 'process_123')

-- Less efficient for single process
SELECT * FROM log_entries WHERE process_id = 'process_123'
```
