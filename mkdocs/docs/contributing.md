# Contributing to Micromegas

We welcome contributions to the Micromegas project! This guide will help you get started with contributing code, documentation, or reporting issues.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madesroches/micromegas.git
   cd micromegas
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**:
   Follow the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md) to set up your local environment.

3. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Rust development
   cd rust
   cargo build
   
   # Python development
   cd python/micromegas
   poetry install
   
   # Documentation
   pip install -r docs/docs-requirements.txt
   ```

## Contributing Code

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/madesroches/micromegas/issues)
2. **Open an issue** to discuss your proposed changes if it's a significant feature
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Follow coding standards** (see [AI Guidelines](AI_GUIDELINES.md)):
   - **Rust**: Run `cargo fmt` before any commit
   - **Python**: Use `black` for formatting
   - **Dependencies**: Keep alphabetical order in Cargo.toml
   - **Error handling**: Use `expect()` with descriptive messages instead of `unwrap()`

3. **Write tests**:
   ```bash
   # Rust tests
   cd rust
   cargo test
   
   # Python tests
   cd python/micromegas
   pytest
   ```

4. **Run CI pipeline locally**:
   ```bash
   cd rust
   python3 ../build/rust_ci.py
   ```

5. **Commit with clear messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add histogram generation for span duration analysis"
   ```
   
   **Note**: Never include AI-generated credits or co-author tags in commit messages.

6. **Push and create Pull Request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   
   Before creating a PR, run:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline main..HEAD
   ```
   to list all commits in your branch.

### Code Review Process

1. **Automated checks**: Ensure all CI checks pass
2. **Code review**: Maintainers will review your changes
3. **Address feedback**: Make requested changes if needed
4. **Merge**: Once approved, your PR will be merged

## Contributing Documentation

### MkDocs Documentation

The main documentation uses MkDocs with Material theme:

1. **Edit documentation**:
   - Files are in `docs/` directory
   - Use Markdown format
   - Follow existing structure and style

2. **Preview changes**:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   # Visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Build documentation**:
   ```bash
   python docs/build-docs.py
   ```

### Documentation Guidelines

- **Clear and concise**: Write for your audience
- **Code examples**: Include working examples with expected output
- **Cross-references**: Link to related sections
- **Consistent formatting**: Follow existing patterns

## Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

Include the following information:

- **Environment**: OS, Rust version, Python version
- **Micromegas version**: Git commit or release version
- **Steps to reproduce**: Clear, minimal reproduction steps
- **Expected vs actual behavior**: What should happen vs what happens
- **Logs/errors**: Include relevant error messages or logs
- **Configuration**: Relevant environment variables or config
