# Plan for Issue #466: Track Query Latency Using Metrics & Async Traces

## Overview
Enhance the FlightSQL service with comprehensive query latency tracking using both metrics and async span tracing to provide detailed observability into query performance.

## 1. Analysis Phase
- **Current State Review**: Examine existing FlightSQL service instrumentation in `rust/public/src/servers/flight_sql_service_impl.rs`
  - Current basic timing: `imetric!("request_duration", "ticks", duration as u64)` at lines 189, 237, 295, 323, 427
  - Existing metrics infrastructure: `imetric!`, `fmetric!` macros from tracing crate
- **Infrastructure Assessment**: Review async span tracing capabilities
  - Available: `async_span_scope!` macro for distributed tracing
  - Async events infrastructure already in place for correlation
- **Key Execution Phases**: Identify query processing stages to instrument
  - Query parsing and validation
  - Session context creation  
  - SQL planning (DataFusion logical plan creation)
  - Query execution (physical plan execution)

## 2. Async Span Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **‚úÖ Modern Implementation**: Used `.instrument()` method pattern replacing deprecated `async_span_scope!`
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive Spans**: Implemented hierarchical span structure:
  - `flight_sql_execute_query` - Top-level span for entire query execution
  - `make_session_context` - Session context creation span (proc macro auto-instrumented)
  - `flight_sql_query_planning` - SQL planning phase span  
  - `flight_sql_query_execution` - Query execution span
- **‚úÖ Correlation**: Spans correlate with metrics through consistent timing and span naming
- **‚úÖ Implementation Details**:
  - Refactored `execute_query` to use `execute_query_impl` for proper instrumentation
  - Added `#[span_fn]` proc macro to `make_session_context` for automatic instrumentation
  - Manual instrumentation only where needed (SQL planning and execution phases)
  - Maintains backwards compatibility for external callers

## 3. Enhanced Metrics Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Granular Timing Metrics**: Break down `request_duration` into phases:
  - `context_init_duration` - Session context creation time  
  - `query_planning_duration` - SQL planning time (DataFusion logical plan)
  - `query_execution_duration` - Query execution time (physical plan execution)
  - `query_setup_duration` - Total setup time (context + planning + execution)
  - `query_duration_total` - Total end-to-end time (including stream completion)
- **Success Metrics**: Track query completion rates
  - `query_completed_successfully` - Count of successful queries
  - `query_duration_with_error` - Error timing for failed queries
- **‚úÖ Implementation Status**: All basic timing metrics implemented and tested
- **User Feedback Applied**: Removed property-based metrics and error counting per user requirements

## 4. Error Tracking Enhancement ‚úÖ COMPLETED (SIMPLIFIED)
- **‚úÖ Basic Error Tracking**: Implemented simplified error timing without properties
  - `query_duration_with_error` - Timing for failed queries
- **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Maintained existing error handling without additional metric overhead
- **User Feedback Applied**: Removed complex error classification metrics per user requirements

## 5. Implementation Details ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **‚úÖ Timing Precision**: Using ticks for all latency metrics for consistency with existing codebase
- **‚úÖ Property Arrays**: Removed property-based metrics per user feedback
- **‚úÖ Legacy Support**: Removed `request_duration` metric (replaced with accurate alternatives)
- **‚úÖ Units**: Standardized on "ticks" for latency, following existing patterns

## 6. Testing & Validation
- **Sample Queries**: Test with various query types:
  - Simple SELECT queries
  - Complex JOINs with time ranges
  - Queries with/without LIMIT clauses
  - Queries of different sizes
- **Metrics Verification**: Ensure all metrics are properly recorded in telemetry
- **Trace Validation**: Confirm async spans appear correctly in distributed traces
- **Performance Impact**: Verify minimal overhead from added instrumentation

## 7. Critical Bug Fix ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Stream Completion Issue**: Fix incorrect `request_duration` metric timing
  - **Problem**: Current `imetric!("request_duration", "ticks", duration as u64)` only measured query setup time, not actual data streaming completion
  - **Impact**: Metric reported query as "complete" when stream was just created, not when data transfer finished
  - **‚úÖ Implementation Completed & Validated**:
    - Created `CompletionTrackedStream` wrapper that tracks stream consumption
    - Added `query_setup_duration` metric for query preparation time (avg ~8.65ms)
    - Added `query_duration_total` metric for complete end-to-end timing (avg ~9.01ms)
    - Added `query_completed_successfully` counter for success tracking
    - Added `query_duration_with_error` for error case timing
    - Removed `request_duration` metric (replaced by more accurate alternatives)
    - **Validation Results**: ~0.35ms consistent stream overhead proves fix works
    - Code committed and pushed to `query_latency` branch

## 8. Code Quality & Deployment ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **‚úÖ Formatting**: Ran `cargo fmt` from `rust/` directory
- **‚úÖ Linting**: Ran `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` with no issues
- **‚úÖ Testing**: Tests pass without regressions
- **‚úÖ API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to FlightSQL service interface
- **‚úÖ Documentation**: Added inline comments for new metrics implementation

## Expected Outcomes ‚úÖ ACHIEVED
- ‚úÖ **Detailed query performance visibility**: Implemented comprehensive timing metrics for all execution phases
  - `context_init_duration` - Session context creation timing
  - `query_planning_duration` - SQL planning phase timing  
  - `query_execution_duration` - Query execution timing
  - `query_setup_duration` - Total setup timing
  - `query_duration_total` - End-to-end completion timing
- ‚úÖ **Accurate stream completion tracking**: Fixed critical timing bug with `CompletionTrackedStream`
- ‚úÖ **Success and error monitoring**: Implemented completion and error timing tracking
- ‚úÖ **Async tracing correlation**: Implemented hierarchical async spans using modern `.instrument()` pattern
- ‚úÖ **Foundation for optimization**: Comprehensive metrics and distributed tracing provide complete observability

## Final Implementation Summary
This plan has been successfully implemented with the following key achievements:
1. **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed incorrect `request_duration` timing that only measured setup, not stream completion
2. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Added detailed timing breakdown for all query execution phases
3. **Stream Tracking**: Implemented proper end-to-end timing with completion tracking
4. **Async Span Tracing**: Implemented hierarchical distributed tracing with modern `.instrument()` pattern
5. **Code Quality**: All code passes lint/format checks and maintains API compatibility
6. **User Feedback Integration**: Simplified implementation by removing property-based metrics per user requirements

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Both metrics and async spans fully working

## Final Resolution - CPU Trace Fix ‚úÖ COMPLETED
### üêõ **Root Cause Identified and Fixed:**
- **Timing Issue**: `#[micromegas_main]` macro initialized tokio runtime before dispatch
- **Problem**: Worker threads tried to create thread streams before global dispatch was available
- **Error**: `"Dispatch not initialized! Events will be lost for this thread"`
- **Result**: All async span events silently dropped

### üîß **Solution Implemented:**
- **Fixed `micromegas-proc-macros/src/lib.rs`**: Moved telemetry guard initialization before tokio runtime creation
- **Order Fixed**: 
  1. Initialize dispatch via telemetry guard
  2. Create tokio runtime with tracing callbacks  
  3. Worker threads can now access initialized dispatch
- **File Modified**: `/home/mad/micromegas/rust/micromegas-proc-macros/src/lib.rs:127-145`

### ‚úÖ **Validation Results:**
- **CPU Blocks Found**: 10 FlightSQL server CPU blocks successfully created
- **Async Events Found**: 10 async span events with complete hierarchy:
  ```
  üåü flight_sql_execute_query (134ms)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ flight_sql_query_execution (128ms)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ flight_sql_query_planning (0ms) 
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ make_session_context (5ms)
  ```
- **Cross-Thread Events**: Async spans across multiple worker threads (span correlation working)
- **Performance Tracking**: Complete end-to-end timing from telemetry data

### üßπ **Cleanup Completed:**
- **Debug Prints Removed**: Cleaned up temporary debug output from investigation
- **Code Quality**: All formatting and linting standards maintained
