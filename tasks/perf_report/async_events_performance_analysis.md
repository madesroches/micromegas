| **find_process** | 16 | 2.58% | metadata |
| **find_stream** | 1 | 0.14% | metadata |

### Key Findings:
1. **`fetch_overlapping_insert_range_for_view`** dominates with **50.8%** of total processing time (363.1ms)
2. **`make_session_context`** accounts for **37.6%** of total time (268.7ms)  
3. **`fetch_block_payload`** represents **10.8%** of processing time (76.87ms) despite highest execution count
4. **Metadata operations** are highly optimized, consuming only **1.1%** of total time

### Performance Variability Analysis:
- **Highest variability:** `fetch_overlapping_insert_range_for_view` (StdDev: 3.18ms) - indicates inconsistent cache performance
- **Most consistent:** `find_process` (StdDev: 0.13ms) - well-optimized metadata lookups
- **Moderate consistency:** `make_session_context` (StdDev: 0.58ms) - predictable query initialization

## Concurrency Analysis

### Concurrent Execution Patterns
- **Maximum concurrent spans:** 54
- **Average concurrent spans:** 11.1 per second
- **Time windows analyzed:** 64

The system demonstrates **excellent parallelization** with peak concurrency of 54 simultaneous operations, indicating effective async execution management.

## Span Hierarchy Analysis

### Hierarchy Distribution
- **Root Spans:** 593 spans (1.27 events per span average)
- **Child Spans:** No child spans detected

**Note:** The absence of child spans suggests this workload consists primarily of independent, parallel operations rather than nested call hierarchies.

## Flame Graph Analysis

### Generated Visualizations

The performance analysis includes flame graph data in multiple formats:

1. **Brendan Gregg Format (.txt)** - Compatible with `flamegraph.pl` for SVG generation
2. **JSON Format (.json)** - For d3-flame-graph and web-based visualizers  
3. **HTML Visualization (.html)** - Self-contained interactive view

### Flame Graph Insights

The flame graph data reveals the following stack patterns:

```
query;make_session_context         268.7ms (37.6% of total time)
partition_cache;fetch_overlapping  363.1ms (50.8% of total time)
payload;fetch_block_payload         76.9ms (10.8% of total time)
metadata;find_process                6.9ms (1.0% of total time)
```

**Visual Analysis:**
- **Widest bars:** `fetch_overlapping_insert_range_for_view` operations dominate the flame graph
- **Stack depth:** Relatively flat hierarchy indicates parallel async operations rather than deep call stacks
- **Hot spots:** Clear concentration in partition cache and query session operations

### Using Flame Graphs for Optimization

1. **Generate SVG flame graph:**
   ```bash
   cat flame_graphs/async_events_*.txt | flamegraph.pl > performance_flame.svg
   ```

2. **Interactive analysis:**
   - Open the HTML file for immediate visualization
   - Load JSON data into online flame graph tools
   - Focus on the widest sections for optimization priorities

   - **Solutions:** 
     - Implement better cache indexing for overlapping range queries
     - Consider partition key optimization to reduce range overlap checks
     - Add metrics to identify cache miss patterns

2. **High Priority: Improve `make_session_context`**
   - **Impact:** 268.7ms total time (37.6% of all processing)
   - **Issue:** Consistent but frequent operation (65 executions)
   - **Solutions:**
     - Cache session contexts when possible
     - Optimize session initialization overhead
     - Pool session objects to reduce creation costs

3. **Monitor: `fetch_block_payload` efficiency**

   - **Strength:** Very consistent performance (StdDev: 0.41ms)
   - **Opportunity:** Already well-optimized but high execution count suggests potential for batching

### Performance Monitoring

1. **Set alerting thresholds:**
   - `fetch_overlapping_insert_range_for_view` > 5ms average duration
   - `make_session_context` > 5ms average duration  
   - Maximum concurrent spans > 75
   - Total partition cache time > 400ms per analysis window

2. **Track trending metrics:**
   - **Per-operation percentiles:** P50, P95, P99 for each span name
   - **Cache effectiveness:** Hit rates for `fetch_overlapping_insert_range_for_view`

The async events analysis reveals a **mature, well-optimized system** with:
- ✅ Consistent performance characteristics
- ✅ Effective parallel execution
- ✅ Balanced component utilization
- ✅ Healthy span lifecycle management

The primary optimization opportunity lies in **`fetch_overlapping_insert_range_for_view`**, which represents 50.8% of all processing time. The operation's high variability (StdDev: 3.18ms) indicates inconsistent cache performance that should be investigated. The system's strong concurrency patterns and overall stability provide a solid foundation for optimization efforts.
