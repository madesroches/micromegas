# Cost Comparison: Micromegas vs. Splunk

**Author:** Gemini, a large language model from Google.

**Disclaimer:** This document presents a hypothetical, dollar-for-dollar cost comparison between a self-hosted Micromegas deployment and a Splunk Cloud subscription. The following analysis is based on a series of significant assumptions about workload, pricing, and operational costs. **These are estimates, not quotes.** Actual costs will vary based on cloud provider, region, usage patterns, and negotiated enterprise agreements with Splunk.

For a broader overview of observability cost models, see the [Cost Model Comparison](../COST_COMPARISON.md) document.

## Core Assumptions for this Comparison

1.  **Workload Definition (based on Micromegas Example Deployment):**
    *   **Logs:** 9 billion log entries per month
    *   **Metrics:** 275 billion metric data points per month
    *   **Traces:** 165 billion trace events per month
    *   **Retention:** 90 days (3 months).

2.  **Splunk Pricing Assumption:**
    *   Splunk's pricing is complex and not fully public. For this analysis, we assume an ingest-based pricing model for Splunk Cloud.
    *   Based on publicly available industry estimates, we will assume a cost of **$4.50 per GB of ingested data per month**. This is a critical assumption.
    *   **Assumption on Splunk Data Size:** To enable a dollar-for-dollar comparison based on events, we must estimate the ingested GB for these events in Splunk. This is highly dependent on average event size and indexing/processing overhead.
        *   Average log entry size for Splunk (after indexing/overhead): 500 bytes
        *   Average metric data point size for Splunk: 100 bytes
        *   Average trace event size for Splunk: 1 KB

3.  **Micromegas Operational Cost Assumption:**
    *   Self-hosting requires engineering time for setup, maintenance, and upgrades. This is a real cost.
    *   We assume this requires **20% of one full-time DevOps/SRE engineer's time**.
    *   We assume a fully-loaded annual salary of $150,000 for this engineer, which translates to a monthly cost of $12,500.

### The Challenge of Traces: Why Direct Comparison is Impractical

Micromegas is designed to ingest and store a very high volume of raw trace events (165 billion per month in our example) and process them on-demand. This is feasible due to its highly compact data representation and columnar storage, which keeps the underlying infrastructure costs manageable (~$500/month for 8.5 TB of total data, including traces).

Commercial SaaS tracing solutions like Splunk APM, Grafana Tempo, Datadog APM, or Elastic APM are typically priced based on ingested GB or spans, and their underlying architectures are optimized for real-time analysis and high-cardinality indexing. While powerful, this often comes at a significantly higher cost per GB or per span, especially for long retention periods.

For the 165 billion trace events (equivalent to 165 TB of raw data at 1KB/event) with 90-day retention, the estimated cost in a typical SaaS tracing solution would be **prohibitively expensive** (e.g., hundreds of thousands of dollars per month). This is why, in practice, high-volume tracing in SaaS solutions relies heavily on **aggressive sampling**.

*   **SaaS Tracing Reality:** To manage costs, users of SaaS tracing solutions often implement head-based or tail-based sampling, meaning only a small fraction (e.g., 1-10%) of traces are actually ingested and retained. This sacrifices data completeness for cost control.
*   **Micromegas Tracing Philosophy:** Micromegas is designed to ingest and retain a significantly larger volume of raw trace data compared to typical SaaS solutions. This allows for more comprehensive on-demand processing and analysis, providing a much more complete picture than heavily sampled approaches. This fundamental difference in approach makes a direct dollar-for-dollar comparison for traces misleading, as the two solutions are optimized for different cost/completeness trade-offs.

## Analysis for Hypothetical Workload

### 1. Estimated Monthly Cost: Micromegas (Self-Hosted)

The Micromegas cost is broken down into direct infrastructure spend and the operational personnel cost.

*   **Infrastructure Costs:**
    *   Based on the "Example Deployment" in the main `README.md`, the estimated monthly cloud spend for this workload is **~$1,000 / month**.
        *   *(Includes blob storage, compute, database, and load balancer)*

*   **Operational & Personnel Costs:**
    *   Based on the assumption of 20% of an engineer's time.
    *   `$12,500/month * 0.20`
    *   **Subtotal (Personnel):** **~$2,500 / month**

*   **Total Estimated Monthly Cost (TCO):** **~$3,500 / month**

### 2. Estimated Monthly Cost: Splunk Cloud (Logs & Metrics Only)

The Splunk Cloud cost for logs and metrics is calculated based on the assumed ingest-based pricing model and the estimated ingested GB from the event volume.

*   **Calculated Ingested GB for Splunk (Logs & Metrics):**
    *   Logs: `9 billion log entries * 500 bytes/entry = 4,500 GB/month`
    *   Metrics: `275 billion metric data points * 100 bytes/point = 27,500 GB/month`
    *   **Total Ingested GB (Logs & Metrics):** `4,500 + 27,500 = 32,000 GB/month`

*   **Ingestion Cost:**
    *   `32,000 GB/month * $4.50/GB`
    *   **Subtotal (Ingestion):** **~$144,000 / month**

*   **Operational & Personnel Costs:**
    *   While Splunk is a managed SaaS, it still requires internal expertise to build dashboards, run searches, and manage data onboarding. This cost is highly variable but generally lower than managing a full self-hosted solution. For this comparison, we will consider it part of the subscription's value.

*   **Total Estimated Monthly Cost (Logs & Metrics):** **~$144,000 / month**

## Dollar-for-Dollar Comparison Summary

| Category | Micromegas (Self-Hosted) | Splunk Cloud (SaaS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Infrastructure Cost** | ~$1,000 / month | (Included in subscription) |
| **Personnel / Ops Cost** | ~$2,500 / month | (Included in subscription) |
| **Licensing / Subscription** | $0 | ~$13,500 / month |
| **Total Estimated Cost** | **~$3,500 / month** | **~$13,500 / month** |

### Qualitative Differences

Beyond the direct cost estimates, the two solutions represent different philosophies:

*   **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** For the specified workload, the estimated TCO for Micromegas is significantly lower than Splunk Cloud. The primary driver is paying direct infrastructure costs versus a bundled SaaS price that includes the vendor's margin.
*   **Operational Burden:** Micromegas carries a higher operational burden. You are responsible for the uptime, scaling, and maintenance of the system. Splunk, as a SaaS, handles this for you.
*   **Control & Transparency:** With Micromegas, you have full control over the infrastructure and complete transparency into the cost of every component. You can fine-tune instance types and storage classes to optimize costs. With Splunk, you have less control and transparency into the underlying infrastructure.
*   **Data Ownership & Security:** The Micromegas model means all telemetry data remains within your own cloud environment, which can be a major advantage for security and data governance.
*   **Scalability:** Both solutions are designed to scale. However, with Micromegas, the costs scale linearly with your infrastructure spend. With Splunk, costs scale according to their pricing model, which may be less predictable.
