## Objectives

### Low overhead instrumentation

20 ns / event in the calling thread, one additional thread for the preparation and upload to the server.

### High frequency of events

Up to 100000 events / second for a single instrumented process.

### Scalability of ingestion service

Scalable backend can accept data from millions of concurrent instrumented processes.

### Tail sampling & ETL on demand

In order to keep costs down, most payloads will remain unprocessed until they expire.

### Query using SQL

 * Analytics built on https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/
 * Metadata stored in https://www.postgresql.org/

## Status

### April 2024
Telemetry ingestion from rust & unreal are working :) 
Released [version 0.1.1](https://crates.io/crates/micromegas)
Not actually useful yet, I need to bring back the analytics service to a working state.

### January 2024
Starting anew. I'm extracting the tracing/telemetry/analytics code from https://github.com/legion-labs/legion to jumpstart the new project. If you are interested in collaborating, please reach out.
